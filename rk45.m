function [U,t] = rk45(f,t0,tf,u0,tol)
% Solves the initial value problem defined by the input function f,
% where f is an atonomous system of n first-order ODE's having elements 
% of the form u'=f(u), with the initial condition in u0. Both f and u0
% are column vectors of length n. The solution is assumed to exist over 
% the time interval t0 to tf. The relative local truncation error is
% estimated at each step and it must be less than specified tol to move
% forward in time.
%
% fixed allocation - approximation stops after 1e4-1 steps
